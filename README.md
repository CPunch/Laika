This is a simple POC botnet written in C99. The net library shares some similarities to [FoxNet](https://github.com/CPunch/FoxNet), in fact lpolllist.c is just a port of the FoxPollList class. This botnet is also crossplatform with clients written for each platform (check the /clients folder).

## Why?

Malware development in recent years is soooooooo boring (esp. malware written by non-nationstate actors). I wanted to prove that homebrew malware can still be interesting and fun! Obviously use this on your own machines/get permission before running etc. etc.
